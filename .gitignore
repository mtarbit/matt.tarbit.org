# See http://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global

# Ignore bundler config
/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/db/*.sqlite3

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*.log
/tmp

# Ignore yaml files since they're likely to contain sensitive 
# information and I'm providing example templates instead.
*.yml

# Pre-3.1 ignores. May need to re-instate some of these as we go?
# _archive
# db/backup
# tmp/**/*
# *.html
# !public/404.html
# !public/500.html
# vendor/gems
