== A Personal Website

This is a blogging engine built with Ruby on Rails. 

It includes support for tumblelog-esque multiple entry formats. These are 
"post", "review", "quote", "link" & "status". The first two being longer form 
entries, and the others are shorter snippets.

It also includes 3rd party web service support in places. For instance, "link"
entries can be synced from a Delicious account, "status" entries from a 
Twitter account, and "review"s can be tied to an Amazon product entry.

This Amazon API integration is also used in a "library" section which acts
as a lightweight tracker for your reading history.

The usual suspects like commenting and tagging are also supported. And lastly,
"post" entries are written in MarkDown syntax and code highlighting is provided
via the Pygments python library.

See http://matt.tarbit.org for a working installation.
